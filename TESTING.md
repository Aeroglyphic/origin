# Testing

This describes Origin's automated test setup. Linting, unit testing, and integration testing is run by TravisCI on each push or pull request.

## Linting

Linting is handled by `eslint`. The root of the repository contains a base eslint config in `.eslintrc.js` which can be imported and extended by the Origin packages. For an example of extending this base config to support React see `origin-dapp/.eslintrc.js`.

## Unit Testing

Each package implements its own unit tests that should be runnable by using `lerna run test --scope <package_name>` from root or `npm run test` from within the package directory.

## Integration Testing

Integration testing is provided by the `origin-tests` package. It uses the Docker Compose setup to run Origin components and then executes tests against those services. The available services and their addresses are:

```
- ipfs-proxy on http://ipfs-proxy:9999 (also localhost)
- origin-bridge on http://origin-bridge:5000 (also localhost)
- origin-dapp on http://origin-dapp:3000 (also localhost)
- origin-discovery (event-listener)
- origin-discovery (apollo server on http://localhost:4000)
- origin-messaging on http://origin-messaging:9012 (also localhost)
- origin-notifications on http://origin-notifications:3456 (also localhost)
- ipfs at http://origin:5002 (gateway) and http://origin:8080 (api)
